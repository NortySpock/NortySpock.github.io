<!-- title: Victor, a sprite-based SHMUP -->
In 2019 I wrote Viktor, a sprite-based shoot-em-up (SHMUP) drawing inspiration from 1942 and Galaga.  
(code is [here](https://github.com/NortySpock/Viktor), play it [here](https://nortyspock.github.io/Viktor).)   

This was again written in Javascript, using [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) as the base library again and adding [P5.play](https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/) for sprite and animation handling. 

---------------------

Neat things I ran into working on this project:  <br/>

- p5.play's vanilla version was not updated to support images correctly beyond p5.js v0.5.4 (Released October 01, 2016). 
  - I chose to use the vanilla version of p5.play with the older p5.js v0.5.4, rather than patch it to another, later, arbitrary p5.js version.

- I added a particle engine. 
  - I played around with a few different ways to store the particles 
    - Originally it was pushing onto the end of the array and splicing out particles when they reached the end of their time-to-live
	- But as discussed in the Asteroids blog post, this is expensive compute work (n to 2n) to save (say) a kilobyte of memory
	- I then adjusted the renderer to just not display particles that had passed their time-to-live, and made the size of the array fixed
	- this means we're no longer allocating and de-allocating memory, we're just incrementing our way along a fixed array and updating and displaying only live particles
	- Computer science (and engineering) is mostly about tradeoffs, and in this case we're increasing memory usage by a few kilobytes in order to save on processor time. 
	- Additionally I simplified the code by just iterating over the array and not modifying it; trading increased memory and compute (iterating over the full length of the array) for less complex code. 

- Adding the particle engine meant I wanted to use it a lot, so I:
  - added shields (popping the shield just used the particle effect again)
  - added a slight warning puff of particles when an enemy was about to burst on the screen
    - This is an example of the Game AI maxim "The best Game AIs are ones that the player can understand, not necessarily technically brilliant." 
  - Used particles for bullets annihilating each other and chipping armor off an enemy.
    - This required me to know what the color of the sprite was before I spawned particles off of it
	  - so once-per-frame (60 frames per second) I'd check a single sprite to see if I needed to get the particle color to be used for a sprite, and then get it if necessary. 
	  - Since "get pixel color at this coordinate" was relatively expensive, again, I needed to keep it to an as-needed, once per frame basis.
  - I do think this particle system really added to the feel of the game and made it feel more active and lively

- While I want to avoid flashing lights (for people who have epilepsy), there is a single frame that flashes the screen when you beat the boss. 
  - I thought this was a fair tradeoff: it cements the game finale and hides the boss ship transition to a wrecked boss ship.

- I re-used the sound manager which was so successful in the Asteroids clone 
- the moving background stars are not actually particles, they are a separate system. 
  - I debated putting them together but I think this would over-complicate the particle system, since background stars are reused and particles are (mostly) not

#### Takeaways
- SHMUPs are fun and an excellent way to get into game development
- Particles are easy, fun to add, and quickly add a bit of energy to the game; just don't overdo it. 
- I'm not going to be making any money off of this game (it's 10 minutes long) but I learned some cool tricks and have a cool finished project to show off as well. 
- I worked with my son on the sprite artwork, and it's cool that he now has a published work given that he is in middle school at the time of writing.
